# Advanced Python Seminar

This repository contains the slides and all accompanying files from a crash course seminar on advanced topics in Python that I gave to CS grad students and to members of the StartupStorm club at the University of British Columbia.

The topics that were covered in this seminar are:

* lambda expressions
* `map`, `reduce`, and `filter`
* list, dictionary, and generator comprehensions
* `@decorators`


## 1. Add auto-complete and history keeping to your interpreter *(optional)*

* Download the [.pystartup](https://github.com/daniboy/pyseminar/blob/master/.pystartup) file and put it in your home directory
* Add the following to your .bashrc or .bash_profile file: `export PYTHONSTARTUP=$HOME/.pystartup`


## 2. Download the seminar file

* [seminar.py](https://github.com/daniboy/pyseminar/blob/master/seminar.py)


## 3. Start your interpreter

* In a terminal, run `python` in the same directory as `seminar.py`
* Type `import seminar`


## 4. Learn Advanced Python

* Follow the presentation.
